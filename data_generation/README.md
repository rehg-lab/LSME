# Codebase details
## 1. Scene config generation
The code for this is located in `scene_config_generation`. We want to generate a `.json` file for each scene, picking the objects, their pose, the lighting environment and floor, and the camera pose all ahead of time before rendering. A sample script to do this is `TOYS_create_scene_configs.py`.
```
python TOYS_create_scene_configs.py
```
## 2. Rendering
Run `render_toys.sh` inside `rendering` with the appropriate paths. 
```
bash render_toys.sh
```
